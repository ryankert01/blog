## Intro

One of the easiest way to connect your Github account with your git installed on Windows is through [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Also, this method has a great merit: it's too easy to encounter a bug! lol!

## Steps to setup on Windows 11

1. install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on Windows
2. install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Login your [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) with your Github account

## install git on WSL 2

1. prerequisites: WSL2, Ubuntu distro
2. if your Ubuntu distro hadn't already install git (which in my case is already installed), or you can install it with 
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```
3. check git version with
```bash
git --version
```
4. setup git global config
```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Setup Github credentials (Personal access token)

1. generate personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

    - expiration set to "No expiration"
    - select all access options

2. click "Generate token" to generate token, copy it
3. clone, commit and try to push a github repo

```bash
git clone <repo url>
git commit -am "commit name"
git push
```
4. It will let you enter your Github username, then your password. In the password section, enter `personal access token` you just generated.

```
Username for 'https://github.com': <username>
Password for 'https://<username>@github.com': <github personal access token>
